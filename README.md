Loading the data frame into a variable 'df'
checking for any missing values using , df.isnull().sum()
Getting summary statistics,and handling missing values

b) Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. 
c) Identified the predominant age group among employees.
d) Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure
e) Investigated if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represented it visually.
We used 'groupby' to find group wise values. 
After these,for the graphical representation we have to import ,'matplotlib.pyplot as plt'
For each of the visualization we assigned plote type, corresponding axis values, and specified colour ,gave name for that plote.
using show() function we could visualize that corresponding output.
